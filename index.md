### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first time I was coding on C++. I have also coded on python before hand but it is nothing like using C++. Although I personally perfer python, I know C++ is great for programming and getting to write code and seeing the "Hello World" pop back into my screen really made me feel like a programmer. 

* Lab 4 
    Lab 4, part 2 is one of my favorite labs that I've created. This program was our first game and it was called hilo. This is a two player guessing game where player 2 has to guess the "secret number" given by player 1.

* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 2 is another one of my favorite labs because it was a way to show how far we have come in coding in c++. As I said about lab 4, this was one of the first games we have done and since then we have had more labs to improve this game but this will be the last imporvement of this class. Speaking of class the code used classes with bool, viod, and int statements to make a simple game into a complex but working game.
